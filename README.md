This is a OSS Development Template for C++ projects based on [cpp-project](https://github.com/bsamseth/cpp-project). What you get:

- Sources, headers and mains separated in distinct folders
- Use of modern [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for much easier compiling
- Setup for tests using [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- Continuous testing with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), with support for C++11.
- Code coverage reports, including automatic upload to [Codecov.io](https://codecov.io)
- Code documentation with [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)
  - With modern CSS [doxygen-awesome-css](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css)
  - Auto publish [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/ja/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) (use gh-pages branch)
- Build, test, coverage, documentation with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.
  - Container image based official clang image [silkeh/docker-clang:12](https://github.com/silkeh/docker-clang/blob/master/12.Dockerfile)
- Use IDE [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and workspace settings/extension-recommendation
- Static analysis and formatting settings, [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) and [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html)
- Use [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) on cmake if installed

## Structure

``` text
dev-cpp-oss-template
|--CMakeLists.txt
|--Dockerfile
|--app
|  |--main.cpp
|--cmake
|  |--common
|  |--external
|--include
|  |--example.h
|  |--exampleConfig.h.in
|--setup.sh
|--src
|  |--example.cpp
|--tests
|  |--CMakeLists.txt
|  |--dummy.cpp
|  |--main.cpp
```

Sources go in [src/](src/), header files in [include/](include/), main programs in [app/](app), and
tests go in [tests/](tests/) (compiled to `unit_tests` by default).

If you add a new executable, say `app/hello.cpp`, you only need to add the following two lines to [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt):

``` cmake
add_executable(main app/main.cpp)   # Name of exec. and location of file.
target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE ${LIBRARY_NAME})  # Link the executable to lib built from src/*.cpp (if it uses it).
```

You can find the example source code that builds the `main` executable in [app/main.cpp](app/main.cpp) under the `Build` section in [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt).
If the executable you made does not use the library in [src/](src), then only the first line is needed.

## Development

Build by making a build directory (i.e. `build/`), run `cmake` in that dir, and then use `make` to build the desired target.

Example:

``` bash
> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug | Coverage | Release]
> make
> ./main
> make check     # Makes and runs the tests.
> make coverage  # Generate a coverage report.
> make doc       # Generate html documentation.
> make install   # Install.
```

## .gitignore

The [.gitignore](.gitignore) file is a copy of the [Github C++.gitignore file](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/C%2B%2B.gitignore),
with the addition of ignoring the build directory (`build/`).

## Services

If the repository is activated with Github Actions, then unit tests will be built and executed on each push and pull-requests.

If the repository is activated with Codecov, then deployment to Github Actions will also calculate code coverage and upload this to Codecov.io.

Github Actions and Codecov can use private repository.

Github Actions deploys Doxygen document to **gh-pages** branch when push. And Hosting service like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) can host pages in gh-pages branch, public or private.

## Setup

### Using the GitHub template

Click the `Use this template` button to make a new repository from this template.

### From command line

When starting a new project, you probably don't want the history of this repository. To start fresh you can use
the [setup script](setup.sh) as follows:

``` bash
> git clone https://github.com/bfkwl2vu4eom/dev-cpp-oss-template
# Or use ssh-link if you like.
> cd cpp-project
> bash setup.sh
```

The result is a fresh Git repository with one commit adding all files from the boiler plate.
